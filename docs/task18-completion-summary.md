**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. New API Endpoint
- **`src/app/api/trips/route.ts`** - Complete trip management API with GET and POST methods
  - GET `/api/trips` - Fetch user's trips with filtering and pagination
  - POST `/api/trips` - Create new trips with validation and member assignment

### 2. New Components
- **`src/components/dashboard/CreateTripForm.tsx`** - Professional trip creation form
- **`src/components/ui/switch.tsx`** - ShadCN Switch component (installed)
- **`src/components/ui/label.tsx`** - ShadCN Label component (installed)  
- **`src/components/ui/textarea.tsx`** - ShadCN Textarea component (installed)

### 3. Enhanced Hooks
- **`src/lib/hooks/useTrips.ts`** - Completely rewritten with real API integration
  - `useTrips()` - Fetch trips from API with error handling
  - `useCreateTrip()` - Create trips via API with form integration

### 4. Updated Components
- **`src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`** - Integrated trip creation flow
- **`src/components/dashboard/index.ts`** - Added CreateTripForm export
- **`src/components/ui/index.ts`** - Added new UI component exports
- **`src/lib/hooks/index.ts`** - Added new trip hook exports

### 5. Dependencies
- **`zod`** - Added for server-side validation (npm install zod)

## Implementation Highlights

### Comprehensive API Endpoint
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation for all trip creation data
- **Security**: Supabase RLS integration with proper user authentication
- **Database Operations**: Transactional trip creation with automatic admin member assignment
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with detailed feedback
- **Pagination**: Built-in support for filtering and pagination in GET requests
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper interface definitions

### Professional Form Component
- **Modern Design**: Uses ShadCN Card, Input, Textarea, Switch, and Button components
- **Real-time Validation**: Client-side validation with immediate error feedback
- **User Experience**: Loading states, success navigation, and error recovery
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with proper breakpoints
- **Form Features**: Date validation, budget formatting, member limits, public/private toggle

### Real API Integration
- **Replace Mock Data**: Completely replaced mock data infrastructure with real API calls
- **Error States**: Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading indicators during API operations
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatic trip list refresh after creation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with proper error types

### Database Integration
- **Supabase SSR**: Proper integration with Next.js 14 using `@supabase/ssr`
- **Row Level Security**: Leverages existing RLS policies for secure data access

- Client-side validation with real-time error feedback
- Server-side Zod validation with detailed error messages
- Date range validation ensuring end date >= start date
- Required field validation with user-friendly messaging

✅ **Creator automatically added as admin**
- Database transaction ensures trip and trip_users creation
- Creator assigned 'admin' role with active membership
- Proper foreign key relationships maintained

✅ **Success redirects to trip dashboard**
- Navigation to individual trip page on successful creation
- Dashboard trip list automatically refreshed
- User feedback with loading states and success indicators

✅ **Error handling with user feedback**
- Comprehensive error handling for validation failures
- Network error recovery with retry mechanisms
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- Form state management during error scenarios

## Technical Features
