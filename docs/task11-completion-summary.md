## üéØ Acceptance Criteria Met

### ‚úÖ Storage Buckets
- **trip-photos**: Public bucket, 10MB limit, image formats (JPEG/PNG/WebP/HEIC)
- **user-avatars**: Public bucket, 2MB limit, standard image formats  
- **outfit-images**: Public bucket, 5MB limit, standard image formats

### ‚úÖ Access Control Policies
- **Trip Photos**: Trip members can view/upload, users delete own files
- **User Avatars**: Public viewing, users manage own avatars only
- **Outfit Images**: Trip members access, users manage own files

### ‚úÖ Storage Utilities
- Upload functions for all bucket types with metadata support
- Download and public URL generation functions
- File management (delete, list) with proper error handling
- Validation functions for file size, type, and format checking
- Path generation utilities for organized file storage

### ‚úÖ Security Implementation
- Row Level Security policies prevent unauthorized access
- File size limits prevent storage abuse
- MIME type restrictions ensure only valid images
- User-based access control integrated with authentication

### ‚úÖ Type Safety & Integration
- Full TypeScript interfaces for all storage operations
- Proper error types and validation responses
- Integration with existing constants and database types
- Clean exports through barrel files

## üöÄ Features Enabled

### Photo Management
- Trip galleries with shared photo uploads
- User profile picture management
- Outfit planning with visual references

### File Operations
- Secure upload/download with validation
- Organized storage with user/trip folder structure
- Efficient file management with proper cleanup

### Access Control
- Trip-based file sharing permissions
- User privacy for personal files (avatars)
- Secure file access through authentication

## üîß Technical Implementation

### SQL Implementation
- **Storage Buckets**: Created with proper size limits and MIME type restrictions
- **RLS Policies**: 9+ policies covering all access scenarios
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with informative messages
- **Verification**: Built-in success/failure reporting

### TypeScript Utilities
- **Upload Functions**: Type-safe file upload with metadata and validation
- **Download Functions**: Public URL generation and direct file downloads
- **Management Functions**: File deletion, listing, and organization
- **Validation**: Size, format, and permission checking

### Security Model
- **Authentication Integration**: Uses Supabase auth for user identification
- **Trip Membership**: Validates user access to trip-related files
- **File Ownership**: Ensures users can only manage their own files
- **Public Access**: Controlled public access for appropriate file types

## üß™ Verification Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Verifications
- **TypeScript Compilation**: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with no errors
- **File Structure**: All storage utilities properly organized and exported
- **SQL Script**: Comprehensive bucket and policy creation script ready
- **Documentation**: Complete step-by-step guide for implementation

### üìã Manual Verification Required
- **Supabase Setup**: Execute SQL script in Supabase dashboard
- **Environment Variables**: Configure .env.local with Supabase keys
- **Bucket Testing**: Run verification script after Supabase configuration
- **Policy Testing**: Verify access control in Supabase dashboard

## üìñ Documentation

### Available Resources
1. **SQL Script**: `scripts/task11-storage-buckets.sql` - Ready to execute
2. **Verification Script**: `scripts/verify-storage-buckets.mjs` - Automated testing
3. **Implementation Guide**: `scripts/task11-step-by-step.md` - Complete walkthrough
